# ðŸš€ Getting started with Strapi

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

### `package install`

First we need to install all the packages in order to start the project:

```
npm install
```

### `start`

In order to start the application you need to run the following command: 

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will run the project on `localhost:3000`


### `build`

Build your admin panel. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-build)
